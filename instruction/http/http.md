üìñ **Deeper Dive Reading**: [MDN An overview of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (`HTTP`) is how the web talks. When a web browser makes a request to a web server it does it using the HTTP protocol. In previous instruction we discussed how to use HTTP. Now, we will talk about the internals of HTTP. Just like becoming fluent in a foreign language makes a visit to another country more enjoyable, understanding how to speak HTTP helps you communicate effectively when talking on the web.

When a web client (e.g. a web browser) and a web server talk they exchange HTTP requests and responses. The browser will make an HTTP request and the server will generate an HTTP response. You can see the HTTP exchange by using the browser's debugger or by using a console tool like `curl`. For example, in your console you can use `curl` to make the following request.

```sh
curl -v -s http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Helping.html
```

### Request

The HTTP request for the above command would look like the following.

```http
GET /hypertext/WWW/Helping.html HTTP/1.1
Host: info.cern.ch
Accept: text/html
```

An HTTP request has this general syntax.

```yaml
<verb> <url path, parameters, anchor> <version>
[<header key: value>]*
[

  <body>
]
```

The first line of the HTTP request contains the `verb` of the request, followed by the path, parameters, and anchor of the URL, and finally the version of HTTP being used. The following lines are optional headers that are defined by key value pairs. After the headers you have an optional body. The body start is delimited from the headers with two new lines.

In the above example, we are asking to `GET` a resource found at the path `/hypertext/WWW/Helping.html`. The version used by the request is `HTTP/1.1`. This is followed by two headers. The first specifies the requested host (i.e. domain name). The second specifies what type of resources the client will accept. The resource type is always a [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) as defined by internet governing body IANA. In this case we are asking for HTML.

### Response

The response to the above request looks like this.

```yaml
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 06 Dec 2022 21:54:42 GMT
Server: Apache
Last-Modified: Thu, 29 Oct 1992 11:15:20 GMT
ETag: "5f0-28f29422b8200"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 1520
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

<TITLE>Helping -- /WWW</TITLE>
<NEXTID 7>
<H1>How can I help?</H1>There are lots of ways you can help if you are interested in seeing
the <A NAME=4 HREF=TheProject.html>web</A> grow and be even more useful...
```

An HTTP response has the following syntax.

```yaml
<version> <status code> <status string>
[<header key: value>]*
[

  <body>
]
```

You can see that the response syntax is similar to the request syntax. The major difference is that the first line represents the version and the status of the response.

Understanding the meaning of the common HTTP verbs, status codes, and headers is important for you to understand, as you will use them in developing a web application. Take some time to internalize the following common values.

## Verbs

There are several verbs that describe what the HTTP request is asking for. The list below only describes the most common ones.

| Verb    | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET     | Get the requested resource. This can represent a request to get a single resource or a resource representing a list of resources.                                                                                                                        |
| POST    | Create a new resource. The body of the request contains the resource. The response should include a unique ID of the newly created resource.                                                                                                             |
| PUT     | Update a resource. Either the URL path, HTTP header, or body must contain the unique ID of the resource being updated. The body of the request should contain the updated resource. The body of the response may contain the resulting updated resource. |
| DELETE  | Delete a resource. Either the URL path or HTTP header must contain the unique ID of the resource to delete.                                                                                                                                              |
| OPTIONS | Get metadata about a resource. Usually only HTTP headers are returned. The resource itself is not returned.                                                                                                                                              |

## Status codes

It is important that you use the standard HTTP status codes in your HTTP responses so that the client of a request can know how to interpret the response. The codes are partitioned into five blocks.

- 1xx - Informational.
- 2xx - Success.
- 3xx - Redirect to some other location, or that the previously cached resource is still valid.
- 4xx - Client errors. The request is invalid.
- 5xx - Server errors. The request cannot be satisfied due to an error on the server.

Within those ranges here are some of the more common codes. See the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) for a full description of status codes.

| Code | Text                                                                                 | Meaning                                                                                                                           |

## Headers

üìñ **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)

HTTP headers specify metadata about a request or response. This includes things like how to handle security, caching, data formats, and cookies. Some common headers that you will use include the following.

| Header                      | Example                              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Body

The format of the body of an HTTP request or response is defined by the `Content-Type` header. For example, it may be HTML text (text/html), a binary image format (image/png), JSON (application/json), or JavaScript (text/javascript). A client may specify what formats it accepts using the `accept` header.

## Writing an HTTP Service in Java

Now that you understand how HTTP works at a theoretical level you can write Java code to make requests from a client and respond from a server.

### HTTP Server

For our server code, we will use a library called `JavaSpark`. `JavaSpark` makes it very easy to write an HTTP server that handles multiple endpoint requests. An endpoint is the code that handles a specific HTTP resource request. A simple code example for handling the `list`: `[GET] /name`, `create`: `[POST] /name/:name`, and `delete`: `[DELETE] /name/:name` endpoints, would look like the following.

```java
import com.google.gson.Gson;
import spark.*;
import java.util.*;

public class ExampleServer {
    private ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<>();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new ExampleServer().run();
    }

    private void run() {
        // Specify the port you want the server to listen on
        Spark.port(8080);

        // Register handlers for each endpoint using the method reference syntax
        Spark.get("/name", this::listNames);
        Spark.post("/name/:name", this::createName);
        Spark.delete("/name/:name", this::deleteName);
    }

    private Object listNames(Request req, Response res) {
        res.type("application/json");
        return new Gson().toJson(Map.of("name", names));
    }

    private Object createName(Request req, Response res) {
        names.add(req.params(":name"));
        return listNames(req, res);
    }


    private Object deleteName(Request req, Response res) {
        names.remove(req.params(":name"));
        return listNames(req, res);
    }
}
```

### HTTP Client

For our client code, we can use the standard JDK `java.net` library to make HTTP requests. The following example hard codes the URL, but the terse nature of the example helps to demonstrate the essential pieces of the request.

```java
import com.google.gson.Gson;
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;
import java.util.Map;

public class ExampleClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Specify the desired endpoint
        URL url = new URL("http://localhost:8080/name");
        HttpURLConnection http = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
        http.setRequestMethod("GET");

        // Make the request
        http.connect();

        // Output the response body
        try (InputStream respBody = http.getInputStream()) {
            InputStreamReader inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(respBody);
            System.out.println(new Gson().fromJson(inputStreamReader, Map.class));
        }
    }
}
```
