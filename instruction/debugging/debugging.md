# Debugging

üñ•Ô∏è [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14CiV7TwmAG-vEWWsQQtaP_-Hx-pqJlGR/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114081115660452804792&rtpof=true&sd=true)

Debugging is one of the most important development skills that you can master. If you can learn how to rapidly reproduce a problem, narrow down its cause, and quickly implement a solution, you will dramatically increase your value as a software engineer.

Knowing what debugging tools are available and how to effectively employ them is key to your success. Common categories of debugging tools include:

1. Visual debuggers
1. Stack traces
1. Logs
1. Metrics
1. Customer reports
1. Development and staging environments
1. Unit, system, and end to end tests
1. Code reviews
1. Performance profilers

The more you think about debugging as applying the scientific method, the more you will become adept at the debugging process.

1. State the problem
1. Reproduce the problem
1. Isolate a problem
1. Form a hypothesis
1. Conduct experiments and gather data
1. Implement a solution
1. Verify the solution

In this instruction we focus on `visual debuggers`. You are encouraged to become experts with the debugger that is available for your development environment. In our case this is IntelliJ. Learn how to quickly execute the debugger, use it with only keystrokes, maximize the use of breakpoints, inspect variables and execution stacks, and isolate a reproduction of the problem, possibly with new unit tests.

## Things to Understand

- How to set a breakpoint
- How to step through code and into method calls
- How to set conditional breakpoints
- How to view the values and local and instance values while stepping through code
- How to view the current call stack
- How to set watches
